# Install DuIO

[TOC]

## Supported versions of After Effects

DuIO has been tested and is working with all versions of After Effects since *CC2018*. That means it works correctly on:
***CC2018 (15), CC2019 (16), 2020 (17)*** and upcoming versions.

DuIO should work decently on *CS6 (11), CC (12), CC2014 (13), CC2015 (13.5), CC2017 (14)*, but you can't be sure, and DuIO does not officially support these versions.

!!! note
    CS6 has a lot of issues with the *Script Panels* like the ones used by DuIO. DuIO will work on CS6, but you may have to close and re-open it often to fix the issues you may have with the UI…

!!! warning
    All versions before CS6 can not run DuIO, sorry! It’s time to update…

## Installation

### **1 - Download** DuIO from the [official website](https://rainboxlab.org)

### **2 - Unzip** the files you have downloaded

You'll find several folders and files.

- *README.txt* contains a lot of information to help you get started with DuIO.
- The *Help* folder contains this help pages. Double click on the file *index.html* to open it.
- The *ScriptUI Panels* folder contains the actual *DuIO* script you need to install.

### **3 -** There are several ways to install DuIO very easily

#### a. Copy the files

Copy all the files from the *ScriptUI Panels* folder to:

- Windows: `C:/Program Files/Adobe/Adobe After Effects CC/Support Files/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels/`  
- Mac OS: `/Applications/Adobe After Effects CC/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels`

You may need administrator privileges to install DuIO this way. If you don't have them, see the other ways below.

!!! Warning
    With the other installation methods, some features using third party tools, like transcoding sound when exporting to Adobe Audition, may not work correctly.

#### b. Shortcut for ***After Effects CC2018*** and more recent

- Open After Effects  
- *Windows*: Holding the `Alt` and `Shift` keys, drag and drop the file `DuIO Bassel.jsx` onto the Project panel.  
- *Mac OS*: Holding the `Options` and `Shift` keys, drag and drop the file `DuIO Bassel.jsx` onto the Project panel.  

#### c. Using the menu for ***After Effects CC2019*** and more recent

- Open After Effects  
- Use the `File/Scritps/Install ScriptUI Panel...` menu to select and install `DuIO Bassel.jsx`.  

### **4 - Restart** After Effects and DuIO will be available in the "Window" menu

## Without installation

You'll always be able to run DuIO without even installing it. This is a good way to use it if you do not have administrator privileges on an older version of *After Effects*.

- Unzip all the files in any folder.  
- Launch After Effects, and start DuIO via the `File/Scripts/Run script file...` menu.
