DuIO imports Storyboard files from [*Wonderunit Storyboarder*](https://wonderunit.com/storyboarder/), and creates a composition for an animatic, keeping the layers, shots, notes and sound from Storyboarder.

DuIO also adds some text layers with shot names and useful timecodes.

- You can choose to either overlay the notes or display them below the frame.
- You can precompose the shots or have all layers in the same composition.
