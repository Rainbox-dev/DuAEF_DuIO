# ![Import krita Icon](img/icons/krita-icon-r.png) Krita Animation

DuIO can import traditional animations made with [*Krita*](http://krita.org), without needing to export frame sequences or video.

DuIO will keep all layers and the animation exposure/timeline from ***Krita***.

1. Export the animation from *Krita* as a *CSV* file. *Krita* will also create a subfolder with the exported layers and frames.
2. Click on the *Krita* button in DuIO.

DuIO imports all the layers and frames from *Krita* and then creates a composition corresponding to the *Krita* project with the same layers and parameters.
